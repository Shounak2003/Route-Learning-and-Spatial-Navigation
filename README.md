# Route Learning and Planning Study

## Overview

This research study, conducted in collaboration with IIT Roorkee, focuses on investigating route learning and planning with the aid of psycho-physiological responses. Participants in this study will navigate through various virtual maze environments, while their physiological responses are recorded throughout the experimental session. The study aims to gain insights into spatial navigation strategies and their correlation with psycho-physiological indicators.

## Methodology

- **Virtual Maze Environments**: Participants will traverse through a series of virtual maze environments to simulate real-world navigation challenges.

- **Psycho-Physiological Responses**: The study involves recording participants' physiological responses, such as heart rate, skin conductance, and other relevant indicators, to analyze their reactions during different navigational tasks.

- **Safe and Straightforward Procedure**: The experimental procedure is designed to be safe and straightforward, posing minimal risk to participants.

## Technologies Used

- **Software: Vizard**
  - Vizard is utilized as the primary software for creating and presenting virtual environments, ensuring an immersive and realistic experience for participants.

- **Language: Python**
  - Python is the programming language employed to develop scripts and control the Vizard software, allowing for seamless integration of experimental protocols.

- **Modeling Software: SketchUp**
  - SketchUp is used for modeling virtual maze environments, providing a user-friendly platform for creating spatially accurate and visually appealing settings.

- **Technologies Involved:**
  - **AR/VR**: Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are incorporated to enhance the realism of the maze environments.

  - **Spatial Navigation**: The study explores spatial navigation strategies, aiming to understand how individuals plan and learn routes in complex environments.

  - **BioSensors**: BioSensors are employed to capture and analyze participants' psycho-physiological responses, offering valuable insights into the cognitive aspects of navigation.
